## Necropolitics 


Necropolitics is a term that refers to people in positions of power deciding who gets to live and who gets to die. The term was first coined by Mbembe in his article « Necropolitics » and has since been rising in popularity especially because of the current political climate. It is often used hand in hand with Biopower, a concept from Foucault about control of the population that extends to health, lives and bodies. The two notions are also sometimes referred to as “deathworlds” which is the space where populations are deemed as disposable, where staying alive isn’t a secure concept. Often in extreme poverty or polluted areas, refugee camps or others, neglect of the population is high. 

For example, in the US right now the term can be used to describe the current situation with ICE, the lack of power civilians face when confronted with the organisation can be worrisome. People have their rights completely ignored and are violently deported into the types of camps deemed “deathworlds”. In extreme cases, people don’t even make it to camps, ICE workers take the law into their own hands. The recent issues in Minneapolis are an example of what necropolitics are. This is an especially important term to understand right now because of the current political climate, and knowing what it means can make it easier to realize what is happening around you.
